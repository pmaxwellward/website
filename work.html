            and go shopping, I had the idea for this film.<br><br>

        <p>My friends Zim+Teemo asked me to animate on this upcoming project they produced for the FX 
            network. Zim+Teemo made all the artwork which I assembled and animated in After Effects. 
            It was hard work, but I had fun.<br><br>

            experiences, completing objectives, and then writing songs about it. You use those songs

    <div class="content">
        <p>A charming little 3D spot done for the 2018 Holiday season. I wrote, storyboared, and 
            animated the characters in this spot and Justin Babin created the environments, colors, 
            and animated the camera.<br><br>

    <div class="content">
        <p>Here is the first Holiday card I did for WGNO in New Orleans, LA. I once again worked on 
            this with Justin Babin (he built that wonderful street car). We spent about 2.5 months 
            building the sets, characters, and then animating them. By next Holiday season, 
            most of the anchors in the video no longer worked at our station, thus nullifying this spot, 
            hence why the 2018 version features no personalities (except Santa). Still a charming spot.

        <p>I made this for The Backyard Film Festival in New Orleans. The theme was "Macho" and
            this is what I came up with. I made the silly song in GarageBand and finished it in 
            about 2 weeks in my spare time. I had fun doing it, but don't plan on tackling topical
            subjects again.

    <div class="content">
        <p>I painstakingly re-created the apartment from Seinfeld in this promo. I used cheap craft 
            paint, cardboard, and a hot glue gun. I think the most expensive item was the wood panel
            used for the floor.

        <p>My first commercial project! I actually had quite a big role on it, too. I storyboarded,
            created the artwork, and animated a few of the characters. The guy tripping with the boxes
            in "Wireless Electricity" is still one of my favorite pieces I've animated.<br><br>
