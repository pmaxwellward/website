        <p>My friends Zim+Teemo asked me to animate on this upcoming project they produced for the FX

            It was hard work, but I had fun.<br><br>

        <p>I animated this trailer for a conceptual game about 
            country musicians through a distorted, mixed-media world while having 
            experiences, completing objectives, and then writing songs about it. You use those songs 
            to tour, perform, make money, and upgrade or downgrade your life as you see fit.

        <p>A charming little 3D spot done for the 2018 Holiday season. I wrote, storyboared, and 
            animated the characters in this spot and Justin Babin created the environments, colors, 
            and animated the camera.<br><br>

    <div class="content">
        <p>Here is the first Holiday card I did for WGNO in New Orleans, LA. I once again worked on 
            this with Justin Babin (he built that wonderful street car). We spent about 2.5 months 
            building the sets, characters, and then animating them. By next Holiday season, 
            most of the anchors in the video no longer worked at our station, thus nullifying this spot, 
            hence why the 2018 version features no personalities (except Santa). Still a charming spot.

        <p>I made this for The Backyard Film Festival in New Orleans. The theme was "Macho" and
            this is what I came up with. I made the silly song in GarageBand and finished it in 
            about 2 weeks in my spare time. I had fun doing it, but don't plan on tackling topical
            subjects again.

        <p>I painstakingly re-created the apartment from Seinfeld in this promo. I used cheap craft 
            paint, cardboard, and a hot glue gun. I think the most expensive item was the wood panel
            used for the floor.

        <p>Part of the same series as above. The scene where the fellow is carrying boxes, trips

            and it remains one of my favorite pieces I've animated.
